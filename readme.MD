# OVERVIEW

## Large Coursework Brief

Your brief is to design and build a responsive website of a magazine or a newsletter. This may take the form of a topical or a news magazine or a newsletter for a club or society. If possible this should represent a real situation. For example:

- A topical magazine should be of interest to people who follow that topic, so find a group of enthusiasts about a topic that would like a magazine.

- Find a club that needs a newsletter and try to understand what that might cover and look like.

Be careful ... make it clear that you are interested to prototype a web site for a student project, and perhaps later show them what might be possible. Don’t promise to build them a web site for this assignment. If you want to negotiate to do that in your own time as an individual feel free to do that.

Your web site should have 5 pages with different types of news and articles. Wherever possible sample content should be representative of the material for that web site. It should have appropriate media, including video and sound clips if relevant.

In addition to the web site, you will include a report.html file with associated images etc. in your site's base directory. This will explain what you have learned in the process of building your site, where you found your information, and how you have adapted any resources (if applicable). The outline template for the report can be found here:

The specific items you should include in the report are shown in the report template and listed in the Design and Reflection review criteria.

## REVIEW CRITERIA

The project can be described as a set of requirements, which are equally weighted in the marking scheme. They are as follows:

## The website in general:

- Submitted URL works
- 5 web pages are implemented with an appropriate hierarchical structure and files are well organised
- Site is accessible, with an explanation of strategies used in the report
- Site has good content – incorporating media (such as pictures, sound and video) where relevant. Content is integrated well to draw a rich, coherent and \* compelling picture

### HTML:

- HTML is valid and well-formed HTML5
- HTML elements are well chosen, and use structural elements and attributes where possible
- HTML is comprehensively commented

### CSS:

- CSS is used to make an appropriate, aesthetic design
- Layout is appropriate and interesting
- Website is responsive, with explicit responsive behaviour
- CSS is comprehensively commented

### JavaScript:

- JavaScript is successfully called and student-written code interacts with the DOM
- JavaScript has an essential role in the function of some aspect of the website (e.g. image carousel)
- Advanced use is made of JavaScript or a JS library is used in a sophisticated way
- JS is comprehensively commented

### Report:

- Site map and wireframes are comprehensive and representative, and wireframes reflect the responsive aspects of the site
- Mock-ups are present and accurate
- Reflection on work (the rest of the report) shows critical and analytical awareness
