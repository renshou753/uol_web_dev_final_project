# Reflective Note

> What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement.

My site is formed by a group of people called "The Secret Hacker". This is the first letter to our audiences who are passionate about ethical hacking and penetration testing.

I chose to use a terminal-like web interface to present this news letter. For our audiences this style is probably more convincing than a traditional grid interface.

> State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.

Well, in general I was inspired by a game I recently played called "Hacknet". It is a terminal based hacking simulation game for pc and mac. The player has to type linux command line prompt to experience what it takes to become a hacker. Player follows the email instruction gave by a remote hacker to trace an incident within the hacker community.

For me it was pretty eye-opening to actually play computer games just like a hacker, hence I was kind of motivated by it to create a terminal style hacking news letter.

Within the process to investigate online, I found plenty of resources demonstrating how to create a terminal like website, for example this article [How to make a Terminal like Portfolio Website for yourself](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-a-terminal-like-portfolio-website-for-yourself-27d7a7030004).[^1]

> State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.

I believe my site is accessible, first of all since this is a news letter, we will be able to reach out to our target audiences by email.

Second, we could provide a pc accessible url to let users subscribe to our email services.

Last but not the least I made css adjustable to smaller screen, it's not perfect but somehow workable.

> State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.

I have considered many usability factors, the site has to be visually appealing, practical, also easier for people to read. I made the site dynamically types the characters as if it was a person, I think it would somehow attract geeky audiences like me to subscribe the services.

> State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).

The most challenging thing for me was to use javascript to let the site dynamically types the characters on screen pace by pace. I had to reference many materials online, for a while I found something useful called [How to make a Terminal like Portfolio Website for yourself](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-a-terminal-like-portfolio-website-for-yourself-27d7a7030004).[^2] However, it appears the author used ES5 to make the visual effects but I want to apply ES6 I recently learned to make this site, so I kind of refactored everything into ES6 syntax to make the code more compact also more reusable.

Also, making all those css are a pain for me, I had to make everything from scratch by checking the effects on chrome dev tools, then basically type all those css line by line. For me it was quite a learning curve, somehow I got used to use all those css frameworks like bootstrap or material design, it was something completely different to make these css by my self.

Lastly, in order to write this report I also learned some new markdown tricks, it was super efficient to use markdown to write academic paper then basically convert the markdown file to html in the end. Here I recommend using vscode since it has many awesome extensions to expand the basic functionalities of markdown which makes the tool super handy for me.

> What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?

I really like the visual parts of my site, for me it is exciting to see my site goes into the direction I was hoping for, and I really wish to expand from here to create something really useful in the future using the design of this site.

> What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?

The content of the site could probably be a bit richer, I only created a few mocks up for the site, the style of the site could probably be a bit more flexible based on the taste of the audiences.

> What resources were used when creating your work? You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.

Like I explained earlier the main inspiration comes from the game I recently player called "[Hacknet](https://store.steampowered.com/app/365450/Hacknet/)". I used a few text transcript from this game to create the tasks on my site.

Secondly, the article [How to make a Terminal like Portfolio Website for yourself](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-a-terminal-like-portfolio-website-for-yourself-27d7a7030004) inspired me making the typing visual effects, I refactored the javascript code to ES6 to make it more compact.

Lastly I also like the online coding competition called [The advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/). They made this online competition in a terminal like web interface which motivated me to make something similar in the future.
