# Reflective Note

> What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement.

My site is formed by a group of people called "The Secret Hacker". This is the first letter to our audiences who are passionate about ethical hacking and penetration testing.

I chose to use a terminal-like web interface to present this news letter. For our audiences this style is probably more convincing than a traditional grid interface.

> State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.

Well, in general I was inspired a game I recently played called "Hacknet"
