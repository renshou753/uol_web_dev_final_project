Hey There! This is the first letter from us "<span id="k"
  >The Secret Hacker Group</span
>".

<p>Let me be the first to congratulate you on passing the preliminary test.</p>
<p>You can introduce yourself by replying this email.</p>
<p>
  Except, well, I'm jusing kidding. You won't be able to reach us unless we
  recruit you first.
</p>
<p>This is something you could <a href="learn.html">learn</a> at this stage.</p>
<p>
  while to an experienced hacker it's a relatively trivial task, surprisingly
  few actually seem to manage it.
</p>
<p>
  To demonstrate you have the ability to join us, here are a few entry level
  jobs you could work on.
  <br /><br />
  <a href="link1">Profile1</a> <br />
  <a href="link2">Profile2</a> <br />
  <a href="link3">Profile3</a>
</p>

<br />
<p>
  To check your position, find the <a href="leaderboard.html">leaderboard</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Is that too much to hope for? It seems like a lot to hope for. I've realized
  that I just don't have time to write this whole thing.
</p>
